## Hyper-V

Hyper-V lets us run multiple operating systems as virtual machines on Windows. Hyper-V Manager is a free Windows Server tool. It performs the most basic VM CRUD functionsâ€”create, read (or retrieve), update and delete virtual machines.

**Hyper-V**, codenamed **Viridian** and formerly known as Windows Server Virtualization, is a **native** hypervisor, It is a **Type 1 hypervisor** that is commonly mistaken for a **Type 2 hypervisor**. This is because there is a client-servicing operating system running on a host.

## What we can do with Hyper-V

1.  Run software that requires an older versions of Windows or non-Windows operating systems.
    
2.  Experiment with other operating systems. Hyper-V makes it very easy to create and remove different operating systems.
    
3.  Test software on multiple operating systems using multiple virtual machines.
